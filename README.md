# circle_area
its my first project..
# its a easy program for circle
shoa = input ("give me the shoa:")
# its shoa number of circle
shoa_number = float (shoa)
shoa_tavan_do = shoa_number**2
#its the p number i think you know what is this
p = 3.14
# its masahat of circle masahat is a pesion world
masahat = shoa_tavan_do*p
# mohit too is a persion world
mohit = float (shoa)*2*p
# its our output for mohit and masahat of circle
print ("the circle's masahat is",masahat,"and the circle mohit is",mohit)
